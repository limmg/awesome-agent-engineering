## 🗺️ The Seven Courses at a Glance

This workspace holds **seven progressive courses**. Recommended order:

| Course | What you learn | Status |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| 📘 [Hand-written RAG](rag-lessons/) | Understand RAG from scratch (embedding → retrieval → chunking → prompting → hybrid retrieval → rewriting → evaluation → engineering) | ✅ 9/9 done |
| 🤖 [Hand-written Agents](agent-lessons/) | Understand AI Agents from scratch (Function Calling → ReAct → tool design → memory → planning → Agentic RAG → multi-agent → capstone) | ✅ 9/9 done |
| 🔧 [Framework Engineering](framework-lessons/) | LangChain + LangGraph engineering (translate hand-written principles into frameworks; each lesson compares "hand-written vs framework") | ✅ 9/9 done |
| 🔀 [Workflow & Multi-Agent Orchestration](workflow-lessons/) | Multi-agent collaboration architectures (supervisor / swarm / subgraphs / parallel / shared state / multi-model; side-by-side comparison across three frameworks) | ✅ 9/9 done |
| 🛡️ [LLMOps in Production](ops-lessons/) | After launch: observability (logging / tracing / online eval) → security (auth & rate limiting / injection offense & defense / guardrails) → MCP integration → performance & cost (caching / load testing / model selection). Take the portfolio projects from "works" to "ops-ready" | ✅ 13/13 done |
| 🧠 [Agent Frontiers](frontier-lessons/) | Agent memory / reflection / Code Agents / trajectory eval / context engineering / long-horizon tasks—teaching not-yet-converged frontiers, growing research-assistant into a cross-session Deep Research Agent v2. **Every lesson has a schools-of-thought comparison + design experiments that validate the gains** | ✅ 13/13 done |
| 🖥️ [GUI Agent / Computer Use](gui-agent-lessons/) | From "can search" to "can browse": Playwright control layer → observation space → action DSL → text/vision/hybrid routes → reliability → web-injection offense & defense → a local, reproducible mini-benchmark → landing on research-assistant so it grows "hands" → evidence chains → capstone. A not-yet-converged frontier: three schools of thought (text / vision / dedicated models) with trade-offs + a SoM ablation experiment | ✅ 13/13 done |

> **Learning path:** RAG first (understand retrieval) → Agents (autonomous decision-making) → Framework Engineering (productionize) → Multi-Agent Orchestration (architect track) → LLMOps (ops-ready) → Agent Frontiers (let agents evolve) → GUI Agents (let agents operate the web).

## 🚀 Production-Grade Portfolio Projects

After finishing the courses, stitch the skills together into **genuinely production-ready AI apps**:

| Project | What it is | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| 📚 [Enterprise Knowledge Base QA](portfolio-projects/knowledge-base-qa/) | Production RAG: hybrid retrieval + Zhipu rerank + anti-hallucination citations + ragas evaluation. **Upgraded to ops-ready v2 in ops-lessons:** structured logging / Langfuse tracing / online eval loop + API-key auth & rate limiting + injection-defense guardrails + an MCP Server (callable by Agents) + semantic caching / load testing / cost-aware model selection. | ✅ Ops-ready |
| 🔬 [AI Research Assistant](portfolio-projects/research-assistant/) | A multi-agent parallel research system: real web search + review loop + multi-model cost optimization + SSE streaming + SqliteSaver persistence + FastAPI service + Docker deploy. **Gains MCP access in ops-lessons L09** (internal + web dual sources). **Upgraded to Deep Research Agent v2 in frontier-lessons:** agent memory (episodic / semantic layered) + reflective dual-channel reviewer (conflict correction) + CodeAct code interpreter (reproducible numbers) + progressive Skills loading + task ledger (cross-session incremental briefings) + trajectory evaluation (mechanism gains quantified). **Grows "hands" in gui-agent-lessons:** browser_tool evidence gathering (detail pages / pagination / evidence chains with URL + access time) + a security layer (domain allowlist / sensitive-action confirmation / injection scanning, on by default) + reliability (loop detection) + a local mini-benchmark. | ✅ Browses the web |

> These are **production-grade landings** of the course skills—not demos, but AI application services you can deploy directly, handle real traffic, and tell a complete ops story with.
> The two projects are wired together via the MCP standard protocol (see [ops-lessons L09](ops-lessons/09_mcp_client/)).

## 🔀 Course 4: Workflow & Multi-Agent Orchestration (9 lessons)

The first three courses cover "single agent + single flow." This course moves into **multi-agent orchestration**—a core skill for the AI architect track. LangGraph is the backbone for 6 classic topologies, then CrewAI / AutoGen are used for cross-paradigm comparison on the same problem:

| # | Lesson | You'll learn |

> All **9 lessons** done 🎉. Each lesson keeps the "hand-written Agent L08 pipeline vs framework multi-agent" side-by-side. The L09 capstone integrates all of L01–L08 and is a résumé-grade piece.

---

## 🛡️ Course 5: LLMOps in Production (13 lessons)

The first four courses teach you to **build** an AI app; this one teaches you to **operate** it—answering the interviewer's "and after your project goes live? How do you know it's good, defend against attacks, get integrated by other systems, control cost?" All changes land directly on **knowledge-base-qa**, upgrading it from "running demo" to "ops-ready v2." Four modules, progressively:

| # | Lesson | You'll learn |
|---|--------|--------------|
| 01 | [Structured logging](ops-lessons/01_structured_logging/) | From print to queryable JSON event streams + trace_id across the chain |
| 02 | [Langfuse end-to-end tracing](ops-lessons/02_langfuse_tracing/) | Visualize per-query retrieval / rerank / generation latency, tokens, cost |
| 03 | [Online eval loop](ops-lessons/03_online_eval/) | Real-query sampling + automated ragas scoring + bad-answer queue |
| 04 | [API auth & rate limiting](ops-lessons/04_auth_ratelimit/) | Key auth + per-key rate limiting—prevent open access and runaway bills (401/429/200) |
| 05 | [Prompt injection offense/defense](ops-lessons/05_prompt_injection/) | Indirect injection (malicious instructions hidden in docs) + build an attack test set and run a breach baseline |
| 06 | [I/O guardrails](ops-lessons/06_guardrails/) | Material isolation + instruction/data separation + output filtering, hardened into CI |
| 07 | [What is MCP](ops-lessons/07_mcp_basics/) | The "USB port" for AI apps: M×N→M+N; hand-write a minimal server/client |
| 08 | [Wrap the KB as an MCP Server](ops-lessons/08_mcp_server/) | Expose kb-qa retrieval as a standard tool; any host integrates with zero code |
| 09 | [Agent as MCP Client](ops-lessons/09_mcp_client/) | research-assistant calls kb-qa—connecting the two portfolio projects |
| 10 | [Semantic caching](ops-lessons/10_semantic_cache/) | Cache hits on synonymous queries, skipping retrieval + generation |
| 11 | [Load testing & concurrency](ops-lessons/11_loadtest/) | QPS / P95 / P99 baselines; locate the bottleneck at the upstream API limiter |
| 12 | [Cost/quality trade-offs](ops-lessons/12_cost_quality/) | Quantify glm-4 vs flash on eval data; per-stage model selection to cut cost |
| 13 | [Capstone: ops-ready v2](ops-lessons/13_capstone/) | An ops dashboard + a production launch checklist tying all 12 lessons together |

> All **13 lessons** done 🎉. Teaching `code.py` files are all zero-dependency or have mock fallback paths so they run standalone; production changes go into kb-qa with a "## rollout checklist." Places that can't run real external services (Langfuse / Docker / load testing) are **honestly marked as unverified** with a fallback path.

---

## 🧠 Course 6: Agent Frontiers (13 lessons)

The first five courses teach **converged knowledge** (how to chunk for RAG, how to write ReAct). This course teaches **not-yet-converged frontiers**—agent memory, reflection, Code Agents, trajectory evaluation, context engineering—where the industry has no standard answer. So the style changes: the README doesn't lecture "the standard way," it lays out "which schools of thought exist, what the trade-offs are, and why we picked X…"; the code is "hand-write the core mechanism + a design experiment to test whether it helps." All changes land on **research-assistant**, growing it from a one-shot "search → write report" system into a **cross-session Deep Research Agent v2**. Six modules:

| # | Lesson | You'll learn |
|---|--------|--------------|
| 00 | [Method warm-up](frontier-lessons/00_method/) | The three-pass paper reading method + reading LangGraph source + running an amnesiac baseline (reference throughout) |
| 01 | [Memory tiers](frontier-lessons/01_memory/) | Episodic (Chroma) + semantic (list) MemoryStore; researcher gets `recall` |
| 02 | [Reflective writes](frontier-lessons/02_reflection_write/) | `reflect_and_store` distills memory + `consolidate` reinforces + forgetting policy |
| 03 | [Skills & context engineering](frontier-lessons/03_skills/) | Progressive `skill_loader`; unify memory / skills / RAG / MCP under context engineering |
| 04 | [Hand-written Reflexion](frontier-lessons/04_reflexion/) | Three-component loop + blind-retry vs reflective-retry comparison + ablation |
| 05 | [Reflection into the research loop](frontier-lessons/05_reflection_research/) | Dual-channel reviewer (text + facts) + conflict detection + targeted re-research and correction |
| 06 | [Hand-written CodeAct](frontier-lessons/06_codeact/) | Code as the action space + process-level sandbox (import allowlist / timeout / truncation) |
| 07 | [Code interpreter lands](frontier-lessons/07_code_interpreter/) | `code_interpreter` wired into writer; report numbers become reproducible |
| 08 | [Trajectory evaluation](frontier-lessons/08_trajectory_eval/) | TrajectoryEvaluator: success rate / steps / loops / attribution + mechanism-trigger detection |
| 09 | [Eval Harness](frontier-lessons/09_eval_harness/) | Switch matrix × task set = mechanism-gains table (regression-style eval) |
| 10 | [Long-horizon tasks](frontier-lessons/10_long_task/) | TaskLedger: TODO tree + resume-from-checkpoint + incremental briefings |
| 11 | [Capstone](frontier-lessons/11_capstone/) | Deep Research v2: five mechanisms in concert + architecture doc + gains table |
| 12 | [Frontier-tracking method](frontier-lessons/12_frontier_tracking/) | Full three-pass reading method + framework evaluation checklist + minimal multi-agent memory-sharing repro |

> All **13 lessons** done 🎉. **Two through-lines:** ① an evaluation main line (L00 sets the baseline → L08 builds the evaluator → L09 harness quantifies every mechanism's gain); ② a context-engineering main line (memory / skills / RAG / MCP unified under the one question "what goes in the window"). Each lesson's README has a "schools of thought" section + at least one "design experiment to validate" exercise. 104 unit tests green; all new mechanisms default-off, with intact fallback paths.

---

## 🖥️ Course 7: GUI Agent / Computer Use (13 lessons)

The first six courses grew research-assistant into a deep agent that **thinks**—but it only has a brain, no hands: its sole channel to the world is search snippets. This course teaches a **frontier that is still unconverged in 2025–2026**: letting the agent operate a browser directly (open pages, click, paginate, extract, download), growing research-assistant a pair of hands that are **steady, safe, and measurable**. The style continues Course 6: READMEs lay out "the three schools of thought (text / vision / dedicated models), their trade-offs, and why we pick X…"; the code is "hand-write the core mechanism + a design experiment to test whether it helps." All changes land on research-assistant; `enable_browser` defaults to off, and all 123 tests stay green.

| # | Lesson | You'll learn |
|---|--------|--------------|
| 00 | [Landscape & baseline](gui-agent-lessons/00_overview/) | Map of the three schools + WebArena/SeeAct/OSWorld primer + hard-task definition + run the bare baseline (what search snippets can't get you) |
| 01 | [Playwright foundations](gui-agent-lessons/01_playwright/) | Deterministic BrowserSession control (auto-wait / timeout fallback / context manager) + slow-load & popup pages |
| 02 | [Observation space](gui-agent-lessons/02_observation/) | page_to_obs with three page representations (raw HTML / numbered element list / plain text) + token comparison (9x savings) |
| 03 | [Action space](gui-agent-lessons/03_action/) | Constrained action DSL (click/type/scroll/back/finish) + parse & validate + structured error feedback for illegal actions |
| 04 | [Minimal GUI Agent](gui-agent-lessons/04_text_agent/) | observe→think→act loop + sliding-window context trimming + mock-LLM zero-API run |
| 05 | [Vision route](gui-agent-lessons/05_vision/) | SoM-annotated screenshots into glm-4v-plus + text/vision/hybrid same-task comparison (tokens / success rate) |
| 06 | [Reliability engineering](gui-agent-lessons/06_reliability/) | Failure-mode checklist + loop detection (observation hashing) + strategy switching + tricky-page before/after |
| 07 | [Web injection offense & defense](gui-agent-lessons/07_injection/) | GUI injection is an order of magnitude worse than RAG (doing wrong vs saying wrong) + action-layer defense (allowlist / sensitive-action confirmation / injection scanning) |
| 08 | [Evaluation mini-benchmark](gui-agent-lessons/08_benchmark/) | The WebArena idea: self-hosted local task set + functional acceptance + two-layer eval with the trajectory evaluator |
| 09 | [Landing: growing "hands"](gui-agent-lessons/09_browser_tool/) | browser_tool.py wired into researcher (async + security on by default + fallback chain + 17 tests) |
| 10 | [Deep browsing & evidence chains](gui-agent-lessons/10_evidence/) | deep_browse multi-step evidence gathering + evidence chains (URL + access time + snapshot) + revisitable report citations |
| 11 | [Capstone](gui-agent-lessons/11_capstone/) | A web-browsing Deep Research Agent: four layers in concert + architecture doc + gains table (success rate 75%→100%) |
| 12 | [Frontier tracking](gui-agent-lessons/12_frontier/) | Dedicated models vs general VLM + scaffolding: a three-axis framework + a minimal SoM-ablation repro |

> All **13 lessons** done 🎉. **Two through-lines:** ① an evaluation main line (L00 bare baseline → L08 mini-benchmark → L11 gains table quantifying every mechanism); ② an observation–action interface main line (L02 observation space → L03 action DSL → L04 loop closure—the context-engineering theme extended to GUI). Each lesson's README has a "schools of thought" section + at least one "design experiment to validate" exercise. Landing adds 19 browser tests to research-assistant (123 total, all green); `enable_browser` defaults to off with intact fallback paths.

## 💡 Study Tips

- **Run the code.** Don't just read. A lot of RAG intuition comes from changing parameters yourself and watching the output change.
- Learn in order—each lesson builds on the previous one.
- When you're stuck, ask your AI assistant—paste the error and we'll sort it out.
